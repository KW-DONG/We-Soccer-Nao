## Throw-in

### Entry Condition
1. The ball goes out of play past the touch-line to the side of the pitch;
2. All foul throws trigger "throw-in".

### Exit Condition 
The ball becomes in play as soon as it enters the field of play, including the ball falling on the touch-line.

### Criteria of the throw-in
1. The throw-in is taken from the point where the ball crossed the touch-line, either on the ground or in the air, though typically a referee will tolerate small discrepancies between the position where the ball crossed the touch-line and the position of the throw-in. Opposing players may not approach closer than 2 m (2.2 yd) to the point on the touch-line from which the throw-in is to be taken.
2. At the moment of delivering the ball, the thrower must face the field of play. The thrower must have part of each foot on the touch-line or on the ground outside the touch-line, and use both hands to deliver the ball from behind and over the head.

### Re-throwing condition
1. The players carelessly caused the ball to fall off the field of play from a throw-in;
2. The ball first touches the outside of the field of play and then bounces into the field of paly again from a throw-in;
3. The ball did not enter the field of paly from a throw-in.

### Infringements
1. It is a "foul throw" for the thrower failing to deliver the ball per the required procedure, or delivering it from a point other than where the ball left the field of play; this is punishable by a throw-in to the opposing team.
2. If a throw-in is intentionally thrown to another player in the field of play with legal action, the other player will be punished with a direct free kick at the point of the foul.
3. If a throw-in is intentionally thrown to another player in the field with illegal actions, the other player will throw throw-in at the original the point where the ball crossed the touch-line.
4. It is an infringement for the thrower to touch the ball a second time before it has been touched by another player; this is punishable by an indirect free kick to the opposing team from where the offence occurred, unless the second touch was also a more serious handling offence, in which case it is punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick.
5. A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in; if a player throws the ball directly into their own goal without any other player touching it, the result is a corner kick to the opposing side. Likewise an offensive goal cannot be scored directly from a throw in; the result, in this case, is a goal kick for the defending team.
6. Opposing players failing to respect the required distance (2 m) before the ball is in play, or otherwise unfairly distracts or impedes the thrower may receive a caution (yellow card) for unsporting behaviour. If the throw-in has already been taken when the referee stops play for this offence, an indirect free kick is awarded.


## Goal kick
A goal kick is a method of restarting the play in a game of football. Goal kicks are often taken by goalkeepers, but any player can take them.

### Entry Condition
1. The member of the attacking team is the last player to touch the ball, which goes out of the field of play by crossing, either on the ground or in the air, the goal line, without a goal being scored;
2. The opposing team fouls in the penalty area;
3. All foul actions trigger "goal kick" .

### Exit Condition
The ball becomes in play as soon as it is kicked and clearly moves.

### Criteria of the goal kick
1. The ball must be stationary and on the ground within the kicking team's goal area (also known as the six-yard box). 
2. All opposing players must be outside the penalty area until the ball is in play. The ball must be kicked (a goalkeeper may not pick up the ball).
3. The player taking the goal kick cannot touch the ball a second time until another player touches the ball.

### Re-kicking condition
1. 1.If the kick is taken with a moving ball, or from the wrong place, the goal kick is retaken.
2.If an opposing player deliberately remains inside the penalty area, or enters the penalty area before the goal kick is taken, the goal kick is retaken.

### Infringements
1. An own goal cannot be scored from a goal kick; in the highly unlikely circumstance that the ball enters the kicker's own goal before being touched by another player, a corner kick is awarded.
2. If the kicker touches the ball a second time before it has been touched by another player, an indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team from the place where the offence occurred, unless the second touch was also a more serious handling offence, which is punished by a direct free kick (or a penalty kick if within the penalty area and the kicker was not the goalkeeper) for the opposing team.
