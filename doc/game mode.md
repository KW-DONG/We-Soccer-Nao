## Throw-in

### Entry Condition
1. The ball goes out of play past the touch-line to the side of the pitch;
2. All foul throws trigger "throw-in".

### Exit Condition 
The ball becomes in play as soon as it enters the field of play, including the ball falling on the touch-line.

### Criteria of the throw-in
1. The throw-in is taken from the point where the ball crossed the touch-line, either on the ground or in the air, though typically a referee will tolerate small discrepancies between the position where the ball crossed the touch-line and the position of the throw-in. Opposing players may not approach closer than 2 m (2.2 yd) to the point on the touch-line from which the throw-in is to be taken.
2. At the moment of delivering the ball, the thrower must face the field of play. The thrower must have part of each foot on the touch-line or on the ground outside the touch-line, and use both hands to deliver the ball from behind and over the head.

### Re-throwing condition
1. The players carelessly caused the ball to fall off the field of play from a throw-in;
2. The ball first touches the outside of the field of play and then bounces into the field of paly again from a throw-in;
3. The ball did not enter the field of paly from a throw-in.

### Infringements
1. It is a "foul throw" for the thrower failing to deliver the ball per the required procedure, or delivering it from a point other than where the ball left the field of play; this is punishable by a throw-in to the opposing team.
2. If a throw-in is intentionally thrown to another player in the field of play with legal action, the other player will be punished with a direct free kick at the point of the foul.
3. If a throw-in is intentionally thrown to another player in the field with illegal actions, the other player will throw throw-in at the original the point where the ball crossed the touch-line.
4. It is an infringement for the thrower to touch the ball a second time before it has been touched by another player; this is punishable by an indirect free kick to the opposing team from where the offence occurred, unless the second touch was also a more serious handling offence, in which case it is punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick.
5. A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in; if a player throws the ball directly into their own goal without any other player touching it, the result is a corner kick to the opposing side. Likewise an offensive goal cannot be scored directly from a throw in; the result, in this case, is a goal kick for the defending team.
6. Opposing players failing to respect the required distance (2 m) before the ball is in play, or otherwise unfairly distracts or impedes the thrower may receive a caution (yellow card) for unsporting behaviour. If the throw-in has already been taken when the referee stops play for this offence, an indirect free kick is awarded.
