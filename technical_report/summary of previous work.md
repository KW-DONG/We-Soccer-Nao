In the first three chapters, the physical multiagent system simulator provided by SimSpark is introduced and describe the visualization principle of the homogeneous Nao robot in soccer matches through joint perceptors and effectors.
###
The following five chapters respectively explain the agent moves its head in the perception system to monitor objects and records objects by the combination of the WorldObject array and visual memory; Use particle filter to solve the poser of localization; After transmitting different amount of bits through the 3D simulator, the corresponding state information was received by the agent; How to adjust the joint position through key frames to achieve open-loop skills; The robot falls are detected by the thresholding rule and the appropriate sequence of keyframes are used to move the joint back to its original position.

Chapter 9 discusses the goalie's two states in the game: assuming the role of onBall in front of the goal, and using Kalman Filter to react to the ball moving towards the goal. Chapter 10 introduces the design of the Walk Engine, which uses sigmoid function, sinusoidal functions, inverse kinematics and the PID controllers to control the joint position, and then uses CMA-ES algorithm to optimize the parameters. In Chapter 11, the team formation and game mode are further studied and the optimal solution of dynamic programming for role assignment function is found.
###
In the following four chapters, we research the situation of the agent holding the ball and avoiding collision; Create a Kick Engine based on OpenRAVEâ€™s analytic inverse kinematics; Analyze the data difference of penalty kicks; Get the result of the game.
